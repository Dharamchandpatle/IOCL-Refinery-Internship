Abstract
Energy efficiency and operational safety are key challenges in large-scale oil refineries such as those operated by Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), where multiple processing units consume significant energy on a continuous basis. Manual monitoring and periodic analysis often make it difficult to identify inefficiencies, abnormal energy usage, and emerging risks in real time. There is a growing need for intelligent systems that can provide continuous insight into refinery operations and support timely, data-driven decisions.
This internship project focuses on the development of a Smart Refinery Energy & Safety Intelligence System that analyzes unit-wise energy consumption and production data to evaluate operational performance. The system computes key indicators such as Specific Energy Consumption (SEC), energy cost per ton, and efficiency trends, while machine learning techniques are used to detect anomalies and forecast future energy usage. An interactive web-based dashboard visualizes these insights, enabling engineers to quickly compare units, identify deviations, and monitor performance over time.
To improve accessibility and usability, the system integrates an AI-powered conversational assistant that allows users to query energy performance and receive clear, data-backed explanations and recommendations. A lightweight risk monitoring component further enhances the system by highlighting abnormal operational patterns that may require attention. Overall, the proposed solution reduces manual analysis, improves operational awareness, and demonstrates the practical application of AI and analytics in refinery energy optimization and safety management
